#
# Some of variables are from the Dockerfile and some are from other places.
#
# * helper.full_image_name - Docker image name with the tag when docker image is built by ufo. This is defined in ufo/settings.yml.  The helper.full_image_name includes the git sha tongueroo/hi:ufo-[sha].
# * helper.dockerfile_port - Expose port in the Dockerfile.  Only supports one exposed port, the first one that is encountered.
#
# env_vars - is a helper method that generates the proper environment Array of Hashes
